# Summary

UD_Abaza-ATB is a treebank based on [Spoken corpus of Abaza](https://linghub.ru/spoken_abaza/).

# Introduction

UD_Abaza-ATB is a treebank based on [Spoken corpus of Abaza](https://linghub.ru/spoken_abaza/). This corpus represents a set of oral texts collected during field-trips to Inžič-Čukun village in Karachay-Cherkess Republic in Russia. Abaza is a highly polysynthetic Northwest Caucasian language, spoken by approximately 38.000 speakers in Russia. 

# Acknowledgments

I would love to thank Anastasia Panova and Elena Sokur for creating such a beautiful corpus. I am very grateful to Niko Partanen and Thierry Poibeau for their help and supervision. The corpus in question was annotated by the participants of [Aspects of Abaza Grammar](https://ling.hse.ru/abazagrammar/project) group, so this treebank would not be possible without their precious work.
