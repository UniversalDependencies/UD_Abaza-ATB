# Introduction

UD_Abaza-ATB is a treebank based on [Spoken corpus of Abaza](https://linghub.ru/spoken_abaza/). This corpus represents a set of oral texts collected during field-trips to Inžič-Čukun village in Karachay-Cherkess Republic in Russia. Abaza is a highly polysynthetic Northwest Caucasian language, spoken by approximately 38.000 speakers in Russia. 

# Acknowledgments

The authots are gratefull to Elena Sokur for creating and maintaing the Spoken corpus of Abaza. AK is also grateful to Niko Partanen and Thierry Poibeau for their help and supervision on the early stages of this project. The corpus was annotated by the participants of [Aspects of Abaza Grammar](https://ling.hse.ru/abazagrammar/project) group, so this treebank would not be possible without their precious work.
